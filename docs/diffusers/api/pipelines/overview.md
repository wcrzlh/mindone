# Pipelines

Pipelines provide a simple way to run state-of-the-art diffusion models in inference by bundling all of the necessary components (multiple independently-trained models, schedulers, and processors) into a single end-to-end class. Pipelines are flexible and they can be adapted to use different schedulers or even model components.

All pipelines are built from the base [`DiffusionPipeline`] class which provides basic functionality for loading, downloading, and saving all the components. Specific pipeline types (for example [`StableDiffusionPipeline`]) loaded with [`~DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained`] are automatically detected and the pipeline components are loaded and passed to the `__init__` function of the pipeline.

<Tip warning={true}>

You shouldn't use the [`DiffusionPipeline`] class for training. Individual components (for example, [`UNet2DModel`] and [`UNet2DConditionModel`]) of diffusion pipelines are usually trained individually, so we suggest directly working with them instead.

<br>

Pipelines do not offer any training functionality. You'll notice MindSpore's autograd is disabled by decorating the [`~DiffusionPipeline.__call__`] method with a [`mindspore._no_grad`] decorator because pipelines should not be used for training. If you're interested in training, please take a look at the [Training](../../training/overview) guides instead!
